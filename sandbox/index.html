				<h4>Ode to Grape Gatorade</h4>
				<p></p>
				I had a thirst that I could not escape.<br>
				I needed a beverage with a flavor of grape.<br>
				A Misty at Dairy Queen! Away I will go!<br>
				I drank it too fast; brain freeze! Oh no!<br>
				Well maybe I should just eat the blasted fruit!<br>
				I chewed and chewed but was still thirsty to boot!<br>
				Grape soda, who loves you?<br>
				I do, I do I do-oo!<br>
				I drank you but my thirst only grew.<br>
				And then I saw the bottle in the 7-11.<br>
				The light shown upon it, descended from heaven.<br>
				Fine! It wasn't from heaven. More like fluorescent fixtures.<br>
				Look, cut it out. You get the picture.<br>
				No, I understand "fixture" and "picture" don't perfectly rhyme.<br>
				I'm trying to tell a story here while wasting your time.<br>
				Anyway, there it was: Grape Gatorade.<br>
				"What? This exists?" My day had been made.<br>
				I chugged from the bottle and it was just what I needed.<br>
				After searching high and low, I had finally succeeded.<br>
				I think more people would get on the Gatorade bus<br>
				If the company sponsored us.<br>
