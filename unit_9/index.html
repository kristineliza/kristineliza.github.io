                <h2> I See that You Have a Hangover</h2>
                    <p>Ah, I see you have contracted a hangover. I can tell because you are sleeping on a bed of beer cases. I'm here to help because I am a doctor. I've been to school and I have read many, many books. You can trust me.</p>
                    <div class="morelessinfo">
                    <input type="checkbox" value="selected" id="hang" class="readmoreinput">
                    <label for="hang" class="readmorelabel"><span class="more">...more</span><span class="less">...less</span></label>  
                    <div class="hiddencontent">
                    <p>Hangovers are caused by having too much fun and making strange decisions. People who contract hangovers are often found either completely naked in a strange place or fully clothed in their sad little apartment the next morning. Common side effects include expelling stomach contents, extreme fatigue, skull-shattering headaches, intense regret, bruises of unknown origin, memory loss, and an overall feeling of what we call "yuckiness".</p>

                    <p>Bio-scientists, physicists, rocket scientists, emergency room doctors, and Greek system pledges have been unsuccessful at finding a surefire cure for this ailment but there are proven ways to ease the side effects. Allow me to share with you some tips you can trust.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">1. Open the curtains and bask in the sunlight.</span> This is the only way to determine whether or not you were transformed into a vampire whilst drinking heavily. </p>

                    <p><span class="bold">2. Roll around your bed and moan, "I'm never drinking again!" </span>The power of a plan is immense. Vowing to never drink again will make you feel better and the moaning will indicate to the person in the hotel room next to you that maybe you are fornicating rather than writhing in agony.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">3. Put ice on your head. </span>Put ice on your head. It will eventually start to hurt very much. Remove the ice. Let it melt on the bed.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">4. Drink more alcohol. </span>This is especially useful if you can only find a warm Mike's Hard Lemonade. The burning and the heartburn let you know that it’s working.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">5. Don't eat bacon. </span>Bacon is far too mainstream to be an effective cure for the hangover. Eat a Hickory Farms meat log instead. This will replenish salt and protein in the body which are essential to both recovery and therapeutic vomiting. </p>

                    <p><span class="bold">6. Therapeutic vomiting. </span>Toxins out and meat logs in, that's what I always say!</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">7. Sunglasses. </span>Often times, the headache associated with the common hangover causes light sensitivity. This can be aided by using sunglasses over the eyes. Do not worry about wearing sunglasses inside, people will just think you are a celebrity.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">8. Talk about how hungover you are to anyone who will listen. </span>Sometimes talking through your problems can help. Telling everyone that your body is in punishment mode will be cathartic and no one will be annoyed with you.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">9. Blame it on food poisoning. </span>Sometimes the symptoms of a hangover overlap with the symptoms of food poisoning. If you never leave the bathroom, no one will ever know the difference.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">10. Future Tip: Never start the night off by saying, “We're taking it easy tonight.” </span>This will not help you with your current hangover, but it can help lessen the effects of the one you will have tomorrow. Mathematicians who specialize in statistics have recently found out that if you start your evening by saying "We’re taking it easy tonight!"" you will be twenty-two times more likely to get knackered to the point of no return, hangoverwise.</p>

                <h2>ME ME ME: A Tribute to Me</h2>
                <h3>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h3>
                    <p>Fun fact: I am the greatest. I devote most of my time ensuring that I am the greatest and making sure that other people know it too. I don't need to cite any references - it's just the cold, hard truth. You might say, "Oh I thought Muhammad Ali was the greatest" or "What about Cat Power? Once, she wanted to be the greatest." If you are thinking these things I must tell you that you have been woefully misinformed. I don't need to justify my greatness to you, but I will because you have an annoyed look on your face and both of your eyes rolled out of your head onto the floor like Halloween meatballs.</p>
                    <div class="morelessinfo">
                    <input type="checkbox" value="selected" id="meblog" class="readmoreinput">
                    <label for="meblog" class="readmorelabel"><span class="more">...more</span><span class="less">...less</span></label>  
                    <div class="hiddencontent">
                    <p>Small, cheerful woodland animals help me get dressed in the morning while singing happy tunes about the weather. I walk outside my front door into the sunshine and all the townspeople milling about drop what they're doing to perform an elaborate song-and-dance number. They sing a Broadway version of LL Cool J's "Around the Way Girl," not because the song describes me in any way but because they know it's my favorite LL Cool J song. A jovial baker hands me a powdered doughnut and I eat the whole thing without getting any powdered sugar on my perfectly tailored vintage dress. This is all because I'm the greatest, in case you forgot.</p>

                    <p>I skip to work and when I open the door to the office there's a hurricane of papers flying around and workers are screaming at the coffee maker, "Why is it taking so long? Caffeine, you're my only friend!" The boss comes up to me and says, "You're our only hope! We have an impossible problem!" I wiggle my nose and reply, "Don't worry, I got this!" and then I wink. I sit down at my desk, tweefully decorated with little hand-painted figures of owls, and press two keys on my keyboard. "Sir, I think I've solved your problem!" The boss claps his hands, slicks back his comb-over, and says, "Bravo! 50% raise for you! Thank goodness you're here!" What a guy! Maybe my boss is the greatest? Psych! JUST KIDDING I AM THE GREATEST!</p>

                        
                       <ul>Other important information to know about the greatest:
                          <li>I only eat organic, raw food lovingly farmed by the family up the street.</li>
                          <li>Every room in my apartment has been featured on Design*Sponge at some point.</li>
                          <li>The President has me on speed dial.</li>
                          <li>I'm a Sartorialist regular.</li>
                          <li>When I think happy thoughts, I actually fly.</li>
                        </ul> 

                    <p>Ugh, why did you put your eyes back in your sockets if they're just going to roll out again? Stop dry heaving! All of this information is important to know because I am actually none of those things. In fact, even though I live in the NH wilderness I am under the false impression that all woodland animals are rabid. Not fun fact: If there's an erratic squirrel in your bedroom fumbling with socks, it's probably rabid. Like all things on this blog, I have to relate this back to roller derby somehow. Bear with me (or go watch youtube videos of kittens - I don't care).</p>

                    <p>The point is: In roller derby it doesn't matter if you are the greatest. It doesn't matter if you invented a way to have gourmet meals materialize in your microwave. It doesn't matter if you run a kitten orphanage for wayward kittens. It doesn't even matter if you are the greatest roller derby player. Roller derby is all about you while simultaneously being not about you at all.</p>

                    <p>Your team is the Mighty Morphin Derby Rangers. Your track is Angel Grove, California. Maybe you're the Green Ranger. You can take on four Putties at once without breaking a sweat. [History Lesson: Before the Green Ranger joined up with the rest of the Rangers, he was brainwashed by Rita Repulsa with the intention of being used as an instrument of evil. He is the greatest Ranger to ever kick a Putty in the chest.] Can you alone save your Ranger team from certain death at the hands of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd? No, you need your ranger pals. Even the Pink Ranger, who always gets stuck up against the wall. True, the Pink Ranger kicks ass and she's fantastically talented outside of evil-fighting, but sometimes she gets kidnapped by Lord Zedd and needs her pals to come save her. Regardless, you need to get on the track and scream, "It's morphin' time!" and assemble the Megazord. If you're not working as a unit, you're not doing derby right.</p>

                    <p>Lesson: It doesn't matter if you have an ego surplus or an ego deficit; everyone needs to get on the same level to achieve victory.</p>
